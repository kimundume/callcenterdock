# Test Company Creation Functionality

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The problem was a URL mismatch:
- **Frontend was calling**: `/api/superadmin/create-company`
- **Backend was expecting**: `/api/super-admin/create-company`

**Fixed by updating the frontend URL to match the backend route.**

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start the Frontend Server
```bash
cd frontend/dashboard
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Company Creation

#### Step 1: Login to SuperAdmin
- Go to: `http://localhost:5173/super-admin`
- Username: `superadmin`
- Password: `password`

#### Step 2: Create a Company
- Click **"Create New Company"** button (available in 3 places):
  - Overview tab → Quick Actions section
  - Account Management tab → top-right button
  - Pending Registrations tab → Companies section

#### Step 3: Fill the Form
```
Company Name: Test Company
Display Name: Test
Company Email: test@company.com
Admin Username: admin
Admin Password: password123
Admin Email: admin@company.com
```

#### Step 4: Submit
- Click **"Create Company"**
- You should see: **"Company created successfully!"**

## 🔍 Backend API Test

### Test the API directly:
```bash
# 1. Get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/super-admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"superadmin","password":"password"}'

# 2. Create company (replace TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/super-admin/create-company \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "companyName": "Test Company",
    "email": "test@company.com",
    "adminUsername": "admin",
    "adminPassword": "password123"
  }'
```

## ✅ Expected Results

### Successful Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Company created successfully",
  "company": {
    "uuid": "jp6ax66hf",
    "name": "Test Company",
    "displayName": "Test Company",
    "email": "test@company.com",
    "status": "approved"
  },
  "admin": {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password123",
    "companyUuid": "jp6ax66hf"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 What Happens After Creation

1. **Company is created** with `status: 'approved'`
2. **Admin account is created** with the provided credentials
3. **Company can immediately**:
   - Login to their admin dashboard
   - Generate widget code
   - Create agents
   - Start receiving calls

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you still get "Failed to create company":

1. **Check Backend**: Ensure backend is running on port 5001
2. **Check Network**: Open browser dev tools → Network tab
3. **Check Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify URL**: Ensure the request goes to `/api/super-admin/create-company`

### Common Issues:
- **404 Error**: Backend not running or wrong URL
- **401 Error**: Invalid or missing authentication token
- **500 Error**: Backend server error (check backend logs)
